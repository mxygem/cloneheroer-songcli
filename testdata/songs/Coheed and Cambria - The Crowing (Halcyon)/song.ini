loading_phrase = This song is about Claudio trying to run away from who he truly is. He spends 10 years in Godder Damm, slowly going insane, and seeing an apparition of his dead father, Coheed. However, he learns who he truly is, and who he was called to be: The Crowing; the one chosen to destroy all that is wrong. Now he is coming to terms with the fact that he might have to kill everyone.
